python -m flask run

# Expected output:
# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
# * Debug mode: on
# * Environment: development
# * Restarting with stat
```

**Test the endpoint in a new terminal:**
```bash
# Test the /hello endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/hello
# Expected response: {"message": "Hello world", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"}

# Test with headers
curl -i http://localhost:5000/hello
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with JSON response

# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in the server terminal)
```

#### 6. **Run Test Suite**

```bash
# Execute complete test suite with pytest
pytest

# Expected output:

# 
# tests/test_app.py ........                                    [100%]
# 
# ========================= 8 passed in 2.5s =========================

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Expected coverage: 100% across all metrics
# Lines: 100% | Functions: 100% | Branches: 100% | Statements: 100%
```

### IDE and Editor Setup

#### **Visual Studio Code (Recommended)**

Install recommended extensions for optimal Python development experience:

```bash
# Install VS Code extensions
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension ms-python.flake8
code --install-extension ms-python.black-formatter
code --install-extension ms-python.mypy-type-checker
code --install-extension ms-python.pytest
```

**VS Code settings.json:**
```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.organizeImports": true
  },
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "./venv/bin/python",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": ["tests/"],
  "files.associations": {
    "*.py": "python"
  }
}
```

#### **Alternative Editors**

- **PyCharm**: Professional Python IDE with excellent Flask support
- **Vim/Neovim**: Lightweight with python-mode and ale plugins
- **Sublime Text**: Fast with Python packages and Flask snippets
- **Atom**: Extensible with Python-specific packages

### Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

#### **Port 5000 Already in Use**
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill  # macOS/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :5000  # Windows

# Or use a different port
flask run --port 8080
# Or set environment variable
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080
```

#### **Python Version Issues**
```bash
# Check current version
python --version

# Update to Python 3.12+ if needed
# Download from https://python.org/
# Or use pyenv: pyenv install 3.12.7 && pyenv global 3.12.7
```

#### **Virtual Environment Issues**
```bash
# Recreate virtual environment if corrupted
rm -rf venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

#### **Permission Issues**
```bash
# Fix pip permissions on macOS/Linux
python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip

# Use virtual environment to avoid system conflicts
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## üìã Code Standards

### Python PEP 8 Conventions

#### **Modern Python Syntax Requirements**

```python
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Use type hints for clarity
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from typing import Dict, Any
import time

def create_app() -> Flask:
    """Create and configure Flask application instance."""
    app = Flask(__name__)
    return app

    timestamp = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    print(f"üì• {method} {path} - {timestamp}")

# ‚úÖ GOOD: List comprehensions and generators
active_routes = [rule.rule for rule in app.url_map.iter_rules() 
                 if rule.endpoint != 'static']
```

    from flask_cors import CORS
    CORS(app, origins=['http://localhost:3000'])
    
    # Educational Middleware: Request logging for development learning
    # Demonstrates Flask before_request hook and request lifecycle visibility

Raises:
    No expected exceptions - Flask handles all errors through error handlers

Example:
    @app.route('/hello', methods=['GET'])
    def hello_world():
        return hello_handler()
    
    # Client request:
    # GET /hello HTTP/1.1
    # Host: localhost:5000

**Educational Focus**: Demonstrates Flask route handling, HTTP status codes, and JSON response formatting with jsonify().

#### Request
```http
GET /hello HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
Accept: application/json
```

#### Response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 67

{
  "message": "Hello world",
  "timestamp": 1705316400.123,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

#### Response Headers
- `Content-Type`: `application/json` - Indicates JSON response format
- `Content-Length`: `67` - Response body length in bytes
- `Date`: Server response timestamp

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Target Response Time**: < 50ms
- **Memory Usage**: < 1MB per request
- **Concurrent Requests**: Supports up to 100 simultaneous requests

#### Learning Concepts
- Flask GET method handling with @app.route() decorator
- Flask request context and thread-local variables
- JSON response generation with jsonify()
- HTTP status code usage (200 OK)
- Performance measurement with Python time module

#### cURL Examples
```bash
# Basic request
curl http://localhost:5000/hello

# Include response headers
curl -i http://localhost:5000/hello

# Measure response time
curl -w "Response time: %{time_total}s\n" http://localhost:5000/hello
```

#### Python requests Example
```python
# Modern Python HTTP client
import requests
import time

start_time = time.time()
response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/hello')
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {response.json()}")
print(f"Time: {(end_time - start_time)*1000:.2f}ms")
```

#### pytest Testing Example
```python
# pytest-flask integration testing
def test_hello_endpoint(client):
    """Test hello endpoint with pytest-flask client."""
    response = client.get('/hello')
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.content_type == 'application/json'
    
    data = response.get_json()
    assert data['message'] == 'Hello world'
    assert 'timestamp' in data
    assert 'version' in data
```

```

### Dependency Security Management

#### **pip-audit Integration**

```bash
# Regular security auditing workflow for Python packages
# Run before every contribution
pip-audit

# Generate audit report for documentation
pip-audit --format=json --output=security-audit.json

# Check specific requirements file
pip-audit --requirement requirements.txt

# Fix known vulnerabilities (manual review required)
pip-audit --fix
```

#### **bandit Static Analysis**

```bash
# Python security linting workflow
# Scan source code for security issues
bandit -r src/

# Generate detailed report
bandit -r src/ -f json -o bandit-report.json

# Exclude specific test files
bandit -r src/ --exclude src/tests/

# Check specific security issue types
bandit -r src/ --tests B101,B102,B103
```

#### **Dependency Update Strategy**

```json
// package.json equivalent for Python security automation
{
  "scripts": {
    "security-check": "pip-audit && bandit -r src/",
    "update-dependencies": "pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in && pip-audit",
    "security-fix": "pip-audit --fix && pytest"
  }
}
```

```python
"""
Secure error handling middleware with educational context for Flask applications.

Security Focus: Prevents information disclosure through error messages
while maintaining educational value for learning environments.

Security Features:
- Generic error messages in production environment
- Detailed errors in development for learning purposes
- No stack trace exposure to clients
- Request logging for security monitoring

Args:
    error (Exception): Error object containing failure details
    
Returns:
    flask.Response: Secure JSON error response

Security Considerations:
    - Production: Generic messages prevent information leakage
    - Development: Detailed messages enhance learning experience
    - Logging: Server-side only for security monitoring
"""
def secure_error_handler(error: Exception) -> tuple[Dict[str, Any], int]:
    # Security: Log error details server-side only
    import logging
    logging.error(f"üö® Security-relevant error in {request.method} {request.path}: {error}", 
                 extra={
                     'ip': request.remote_addr,
                     'user_agent': request.headers.get('User-Agent'),
                     'timestamp': time.time()
                 })
    
    # Security: Determine safe error message based on environment
    is_development = app.config.get('ENV') == 'development'
    safe_message = str(error) if is_development else 'Internal Server Error'
    
    # Educational Context: Show security consideration in response
    response_data = {
        'error': 'Internal Server Error',
        'message': safe_message,
        'status': 500,
        'timestamp': time.time(),
        # Security: Never include stack traces in responses
        **(({'hint': 'Check server logs for detailed error information'} if is_development else {}))
    }
    
    return jsonify(response_data), 500
