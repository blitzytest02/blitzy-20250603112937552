## HUMAN INPUTS NEEDED

| Task | Description | Priority | Estimated Hours |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| QA/Bug Fixes | Examine generated Python code for syntax errors, fix pip dependency issues, validate Flask v3.1.1 compatibility, ensure all Python imports are correct, verify virtual environment setup | High | 5 |
| Environment Configuration | Set up Flask environment variables for production deployment, configure FLASK_ENV and PORT settings, create .env.example file with python-dotenv, validate environment-specific configurations | High | 2 |
| Dependency Updates | Run pip-audit and safety to fix Python package vulnerabilities, update requirements.txt, verify all dependencies are compatible with Python 3.12+, ensure Flask v3.1.1 and Gunicorn are properly installed | High | 2 |
| API Key Management | Although not required for this simple Flask app, document best practices for future API integrations, create placeholder configuration for potential future enhancements using python-dotenv | Medium | 1 |
| Security Validation | Verify Flask security headers are configured, validate bandit security analysis results, test Python security best practices, ensure error messages don't expose sensitive information, validate HTTPS readiness for Gunicorn production | High | 2 |
| Performance Testing | Run pytest-benchmark to verify <50ms warm response time, test concurrent request handling (100+ requests), validate memory usage stays under 75MB using psutil monitoring, optimize Flask startup time | Medium | 1.5 |
| Docker Registry Setup | Configure container registry credentials for Python containers, push Docker images to registry, set up automated Python container scanning, document Flask container deployment process | Medium | 1 |
| Production Deployment | Deploy Flask app to chosen platform (Heroku/Render/Railway), configure production Gunicorn environment variables, set up Flask health monitoring, validate production WSGI endpoints | High | 0.5 |
